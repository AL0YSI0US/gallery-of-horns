````javascript
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

* Michelle helped me unbreak my page when It was failing to render. Turned out I only had one part of bootstrap installed. which leads me to my next thank you...
* Hexx provided me with the `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap` command line to ensure I'm getting all the goods when I set up a project.

## ü§î R E F L E C T I O N S

* Creating templates for repetitive work makes my life simpler. I needed to render an image...a whole lot! I made a template so I did not miss any key pieces along the way, here's what that looked like:

````html
     <HornedBeast title="" image_url="" keyword="" description="" alt="" />
````

## ‚ù§Ô∏è G R A T T I T U D E

+ **SHOUT OUT** to TA Bryant who helped me sort out my Gallery of horns files. He also showed me how to use a shadowbox tool called: [cssgenerator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html)
+ **SHOUT OUT** to Tom who showed me how to save code snippets while I traverse the web
+ **SHOUT OUT** to Madeline who told me to look into the CSS `!important` rule: *it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!*
  + The only way to override an `!important` rule is to include another `!important` rule on a declaration with the same (or higher) specificity in the source code.
