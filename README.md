**To ensure I am installing both parts of Bootstrap, I use the following installation command:**

````javascript
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

                                     resource: TA hexx
````

### üë• C O L L A B O R A T O R S

* Michelle helped me unbreak my page when It was failing to render. Turned out I only had one part of bootstrap installed. which leads me to my next thank you...
* Hexx provided me with the `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap` command line to ensure I'm getting all the goods when I set up a project.

### ü§î R E F L E C T I O N S

* Creating templates for repetitive work makes my life simpler. I needed to render an image...a whole lot! I made a template so I did not miss any key pieces along the way, here's what that looked like:

````html
     <HornedBeast title="" image_url="" keyword="" description="" alt="" />
````

+ **SHOUT OUT** to Tom who showed me how to save code snippets while I traverse the web
